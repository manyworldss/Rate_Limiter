Flask Rate Limiter Project

Project Overview

Built a custom rate limiter using Flask to control API access and prevent abuse. The system tracks and limits user requests based on IP addresses, implementing a rolling time window approach.
Technical Implementation

Framework: Flask web framework

Core Logic: Tracks requests using an in-memory data structure (defaultdict) with IP-based tracking
Time Management: Uses Python's datetime for rolling window implementation
Request Tracking: Maintains timestamps of requests and automatically cleans expired entries

Key Features

Rolling time window (1 minute) for request tracking
IP-based request limiting
Automatic cleanup of expired request data
Real-time request counting

Technical Skills Demonstrated

RESTful API design
Resource management
Concurrency handling
Data structure optimization
Clean code practices

Why This Matters
Rate limiting is a crucial component in modern web applications for:

Preventing API abuse
Managing server resources
Ensuring fair usage across users
Protecting against DoS attacks

Future Enhancements

Redis integration for distributed systems
Custom rate limits per endpoint
User authentication integration
Response headers for rate limit status

This project demonstrates understanding of web security, API design, and resource management - all critical skills in backend development.
